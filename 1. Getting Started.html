<!-- 
What should I first consider when making a quiz?
- The structure that represent the quiz.

For a quiz, the data structure will be questions and answers.
Each question-problem will be an object, with a property of a question, an array
of multiple answers, and the index of the correct answer inside it.

All of these objects are stored inside an array.
This array represents the problems of the quiz.
