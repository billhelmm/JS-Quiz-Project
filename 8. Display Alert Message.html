Now, we'll add an alert message to give an user important feedback.

It will tell them whether they've gotten an answer correct, incorrect,
or that they haven't chosen one.

We want this message to show right above our answers.
So, we'll create an 'alert' container above the ul tag (which contains the list of answers).

We'll create a div and give it a class of "alert". Since the alert message will vary, 
we'll add the message in dynamically. We'll leave the container empty for now.

<div class="alert"></div>

We don't want a user to get a message right as they click an option, because they can use it to cheat
before submitting the question. So, we'll add the message when the the form is 'submitted'.

Earlier, we logged a selected radio button when the submit event was 'heard'. This was done within
the event listener callback. We'll create the message in here.

Before creating a message for the alert, we have to select it from the element(<form>) that submitted the listener event.

We'll create an alert variable using the event object's target and a CSS selector.

const alert = e.target.querySelector('div.alert')

The '.' in a CSS selector denotes a class name.

Now that we have our alert element, we can do something with it.

What do we do?

We want 1 of 3 messages to show: 'you got it right', 'you got it wrong', 'please select an answer'.

Each message is conditional. An alert message saying you got the answer correct depends on a condition being met.
An alert message saying you got the answer wrong depends on a different condition being met.

We only want one condition to be true at a time, bc we only want one message to show at a time.
So they'll have to be unique.

Earlier, we gave each input a data-correct attribute, with a value of 'true' or 'false'.
We can use these values to determine whether a selected input will get a 'correct' or 'wrong' message.

How do we know when an answer isn't selected?

When we don't choose an answer and submit the form, our console will log a 'null' value. 
We'll use this 'null value' for our last message.

To create these alert messages, we'll write conditional statements.
When these statements are met, they will change the inner HTML of the 'alert' element.

alert.innerHTML = 'Please select an Answer'

For the statement, we'll compare the selected Input with a value of 'null' (no input was selected),
a value of 'true' or 'false'.

Our statements will say: 'selectedInput === null', 'selectedInput.dataset.correct === "true"',
and 'selectedInput.dataset.correct === "false"'
