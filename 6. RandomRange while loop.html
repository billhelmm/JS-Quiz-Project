The next thing we want to do is randomize our answers.

In our code, we want to give our list item a number from a randomized array.

To set this up, we'll use CSS styling.

CSS has a property called 'order' which determines the order of list items in a 'flex' container.
This 'order' property is where we'll eventually insert a random number for each list item.

The 'flex' container will be an inline style for the ul tag, and the order property will be
an inline style for the li tag.

Flex, by default, displays items horizontally. We don't want our anwsers to be side-by-side,
so we'll display them vertically.

<ul style="display:flex; flex-direction:column">

<li style="order:">

To return a number from a random array, we'll need to do a couple things.
1. create a helper function that returns a random number
2. create a new function that uses the helper function to grab, at random, a number from an ordered array
and put it in a 'random' array

Our "random number" function will take a number input and return a random number between 0 and the input - 1.

Since we'll grab (all items) from an array (at random), this range makes sense. 0 is the first index and the
input will be our array's length.

function random (n) {} // n represents the amount of answer for each question

But, how do we create this range and get a random number from it?

To start we'll use the 'Math' object and one of its properties, the 'random' method.

Math.random()

The 'random' method by default gives us a random decimal number between 0-1; it doesn't take a parameter.

What we want is to enlarge this range to the length of our answers array, round down the decimal
to a whole number, and return that. That way, we get a random number from a range between 0 to array.length -1.

We can do this by multiplying by our function parameter (n) and round-down using another Math method called 'floor', 
which rounds-down a decimal number; floor can take a parameter.

function random(n) {
    const r= Math.random() * n
    return Math.floor(r)
}

Great, we've finished creating a helper function that returns a random number.
Next, we'll use this function to 'help' a new function get a range of random numbers. These numbers will be stored in an array.

This new function will be composed of two separate arrays: an ordered array, and a randomized array.
Initially, both will be set as empty. 

function randomRange(x) {
    const arr=[]
    const randomArr=[]
}

The function will fill up the ordered array, then take away from it at random to fill up the randomized array. 
In the end, the ordered array will be empty, and the randomized array will be full.

We'll populate the empty ordered string with a for loop.
The for loop will push a range of numbers using the counter.

for (let i=0; i<x; i+=1) {           // [0,1,2,3,....]
    arr.push(i)
}

This gives us an array of ordered numbers. 

Now, we'll begin to take those numbers at random.
 
We'll create a 'while' loop to determine how the empty 'random' array will be filled.
This loop will run while the first array is filled. Once its empty, the loop will stop.

while (arr.length>0) {}

We'll utilize the 'helper' function from earlier to define a random index from an array, 
using the array's length to establish the range. This index will be used as a reference to locate the value
it belongs to (and eventually where to splice the ordered array at).

while (arr.length>0) {
    const randomIndex= random(arr.length)
}

Now, we'll define a random number as an item chosen from the ordered array using the random index.

const randomNumber= arr[randomIndex]

Great, we're almost there.

The next steps are to now push the random number into the random array and remove it from the ordered array.

We'll add to the random array by pushing the random number

randomArr.push(randomNumber)

And remove from the ordered array using the index and 'splice'

'Splice' takes two parameters: Where in the array you'll start to remove at (index-location), and how many items 
you want to remove

arr.splice(randomIndex, 1)

This splicing ensures that the While loop will reach a terminal condition, as the ordered array is now losing an item
per iteration. Otherwise, we would have an endless loop.

Lastly, we'll return the randomized array result.

return randomArr

Soon, we'll feed values from our randomized array into our list's inline order property.
