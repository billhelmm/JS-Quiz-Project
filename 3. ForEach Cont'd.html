<!-- 
So far, we've created for our init (quiz-creating) structure a forEach loop
that generates some html.

The next step is created answers for our generating html.

W/in the loop, we want to define where we're getting our 'answers' from
and how they'll be generated.

Just like our questions from the js data structure, we'll also create
a forEach loop to run (htm-creating) code on our answers-data

Since each question has only one correct answer, we'll use radio buttons
and group them using the 'name' attribute.

So far, this sound like what we want, but a new problem is posed:
ALL radios, across every question, is in the SAME group. If you were to select 
an answer from question-2, it would deactivate the answer you chose previously
from question-1.

What you have to do is create a new radio group for each question.

To understand how to do this, you need to know about another aspect
of forEach loop. 

When forEach takes a 'callback' (fnc), that callback gets a couple parameters
from forEach. It guves you a value from the array you're calling forEach on, 
and an index from that array.

This index is what we need to create a new radio group for each question.
We can incorporate the index parameter in our forEach loop in order to
group radios, using the name attribute, by question index.
