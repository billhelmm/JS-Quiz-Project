Next, we're going to check if an input (our radio button) is true or false.

Specifically, we'll add a data-attribute to our input, select the input
from our listener event callback, and ask if it has a value of true or false. 

First, we'll 'query' for elements in the event target (<form>).
For our practice, we are going to select our input.

To query for a element, you can use querySelector() or querySelectorAll().
Since there's only one right answer for each question, we'll use querySelector(),
which returns only one item (the first it finds).

e.target.querySelector()

Now, we need a 'CSS selector' that can look at all of our elements in our form (the target)
and get just the inputs

('input')

If you have other input types in your form, you can make your selector more specific. 
You can use brackets, and inside specify an attribute. In our case, if we had more than 
one input type, we would specify the type.

('input[type=radio]')

If we log this, the console will print the first radio input element it identifies and its attributes
(the entire tag)

If we used querySelectorAll(), the console would print a 'node' list of
every radio input element.

Lastly, we can add a pseudo-class that gets only 'checked' radio inputs

('input[type=radio]:checked')

So, the input is the tag, the brackets say the tag has an attribute, and the colon
specifies a pseudoclass for the tag.

We'll declare a variable to assign this input selection.

const selectedInput = e.target.querySelector('input:checked')

If we log selectedInput, the console will print the checked
input -- the element and its attributes -- at submit.


The names or 'identifiers' you give for variables and functions are super important
to writing code.

If the names don't make sense, it's hard to understand your code

Now that we know how to get a selected input, the next step is to figure out
how to know if the selected input is correct or not.

Since we've specified that our selected input is a checked radio button,
What we'll do is add a data-property attribute to our button to say whether it's
correct or not. 

data-correct =""

If we write something like "${question.correct}" and log the selected input, it will contain
an attribute of the correct answer's index.

That's fine, but it doesn't directly tell us whether the input is correct or not.

What we want instead is to have the attribute say a correct input is 'true' 
and an incorrect input is 'false'.

To do this, we'll compare two things with a logical operator. A logical, or 'boolean',
operator returns a value of true or false.

We'll use the equivalency operator to compare the 'correct' index with the input's index.

....
question.a.forEach( function(answer,aIndex) {
....
data-correct= "${question.correct === aIndex}"


When we 'submit', we can get the selected input and ask it if their 'data-correct' is true or false.
