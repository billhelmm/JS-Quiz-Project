<!-- 
The next step is defining the structure for the fnc that will run and generate our quiz.
This fnc is known as 'init', short for initialize.

For the structure, we'll want to have something that loops through
the array of questions (the javascript data structure we created earlier).
For each question we run code that creates html, which will go inside our empty div.
