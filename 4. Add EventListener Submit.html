<!-- 
Adding an event listener gives user functionality to our page. 
It allows the user to interact with a page and change its appearance.

What we need now is a button to submit our answers when we're done.
To do this, we'll simply add a button to our generating form 
with type 'submit'.

Keep in mind that this generating html doesn't exist in the source code (html),
but in our script. When our page first loads, the forms don't exist.

So, to handle submits we need to 'listen' to them dynamically in JS.

To listen to submit messages, we'll add an event listener.
Event listeners take two parameters: an event name (chosen from a long list of 
JS event types), and a callback that runs code when the event is 'heard'.

For our practice, we'll add a submit event listener to our quiz dom element.
This element isn't the form, but any submit messages that bubble-up in our forms 
are w/in this 'quizEl'.

When the submit event occurs, quizEl will be notified of it and will run the callback.

The event listener callback, like the forEach callback, takes a parameter.
This parameter is the event 'object', which describes the event that just occurred.

In our case, if we want to test our event listener by logging into the console
the event object, nothing will show up.

That's because a form's default behavior when submitted is to refresh the page.
When this happens, our page reloads, the form is added, the event listener is added,
and everything you just did (logging the event object at submit) is erased.

Any DOM event type has shared methods and properties that can be used to customize 
an event's default 'actions'.
One of which is the method '.preventDefault()'. This prevents an event's default action
from occurring.

The logged event object, like the question objects from our data array, also have properties.
One of these properties is 'target', the element which submitted our event; in other words,
the 'target' is what generated our event.

Console - target: <form>
